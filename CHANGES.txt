Changes made in Castalia-3.2:

 - Added files .cproject, .nedfolders, .oppbuildspec, and .project to allow
   Castalia-3.2 to be imported to OMNeT++ IDE as a project.

 - Castalia, CastaliaResults, and CastaliaPlot scripts: changes to make it
   possible to execute those scripts on Windows, for all OMNeT++ 4.x versions.

 - CastaliaModule.cc and CastaliaModule.h: changes to redirect Castalia 
   simulation traces to the console of the OMNeT++ IDE and to suppress the 
   generation of results file, which can only be completely generated from the
   command prompt by the Castalia script.

 - Node.ned and SensorNetwork.ned: changes to the import lines, which were 
   causing error alerts in the IDE text editor.
